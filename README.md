# RosWindows2021ExampleProject
This description is still very much in-progress.  
This is a Unity 2021.3.21f1 version project with ROS2 Humble Support.  
ROS2 Humble support was provided by using the https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2-for-unity repository.  
I will make sure to credit this repository in my software license once I create it
The ROS2 Humble support comes from a custom unity package created via the instructions on the ros2-for-unity repository
Note that to test ROS2 communication with this, you'll likely have to manually change the firewall rules for your Unity Editor to allow it to communicate over the network.  
Otherwise you might not get network communication to and from ROS2 nodes running on different computers or in WSL Ubuntu 22.04
